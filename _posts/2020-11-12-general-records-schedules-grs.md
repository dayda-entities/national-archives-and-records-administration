The General Records Schedules (GRS) are issued by the Archivist of the United States to provide agencies with disposition authority for records common to several or all Federal Government agencies. These schedules authorize (36 CFR 1227.10), after specified periods of time, the destruction of temporary records or the transfer of permanent records to the National Archives of the United States (NARA). “The GRS” refers to the entire set of schedules, but “GRS” is also commonly used to refer to a single schedule within the whole.

The data is 45 comma-separated values (CSV) files, one for each schedule in GRS Transmittal 30 (December 2019), plus a data dictionary listing the fields exported from ERA, and a brief feedback survey.
